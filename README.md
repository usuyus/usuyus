### welcome to the abyss where i keep some of my code

- uh, you might recognize that it is a bit barren in here. that's mostly because i only post stuff that have the potential to be "completed" and shown to people online :/
- i do competitive programming, so don't expect my code to be clean and descriptive.
- there are A LOT of projects that i could be working on but i'm wasting my time here instead.
