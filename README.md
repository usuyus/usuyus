### welcome to the abyss where i keep some of my code

- you might recognize that it is a bit barren in here. that's because most of my projects live locally on my computer and i haven't had the chance / motivation to upload them :/
- although some bad habits from competitive programming still persist, i strive to write clean and descriptive code in other contexts.
- there are A LOT of projects that i could be working on but i'm wasting my time here instead...
